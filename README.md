2. Emotion Tracking: The app monitors the child's emotional state during interactions and logs changes over time, providing alerts and notifications when significant emotional shifts occur.
3. Visual Feedback: The app provides a simple interface with visual cues, such as emojis or color-coded indicators, to help parents quickly grasp the child's emotional state.
4. Emotion History: The app maintains a history of detected emotions, providing insights into patterns or triggers linked to a specific emotion.
5. Integration into a broader platform: The app can be integrated into a wider platform that includes behavioral tracking and health monitoring, offering an extensive overview of a child's well-being.
6. Sharing Emotional Data: The app allows parents to share emotional data with pediatricians for better-informed consultation.
7. Support for Children with Special Needs: The app can be useful for children with autism or other communication challenges, helping to bridge the gap between their emotions and how they express them.
